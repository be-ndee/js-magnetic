# js-magnetic

My goal was to create a field that has 'magnetic' lines. They act like a magnetic field. In the current version, the problem is, that I think and programmed that the lines only point to the mouse-pointer. But I don't know why, but they currently act like a magnetic field...

## SETUP

``` bower install jquery ```
